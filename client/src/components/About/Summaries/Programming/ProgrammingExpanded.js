        During my years in school, maths was always my favorite subject.
        Therefore, I wanted to try my hand at maths on a univeristy level after
        I graduated high school (gymnasiet). For some reason, I didn't enjoy it
        as much on a university level and quickly gave up on it. At that point,
        I didn't know what I wanted to do as a profession. I loved computers so
        I applied for a beginner's C++ programming university course and I have
        been hooked ever since.

        After the first programming course, I tried my hand at Java and then
        went back to C++ in the form of 2 video game AI courses. I also took a
        C# course, and a mobile programming course.
      </p>

        At this point I felt like I needed to focus my attention on one area of
        programming. I found a 2 year university program for web development
        with the option to do a third year for a bachelor degree in computer
        science. I completed the three year program and received my bachelor
        degree in computer science in 2020.

        Out of all the different types of programming I've tried, web
        development is the one I've enjoyed the most. You get to work with both
        graphical components and algorithms, which I like. It is also a lot
        easier to work with than something like WPF.
