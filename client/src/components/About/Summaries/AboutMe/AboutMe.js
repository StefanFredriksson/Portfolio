      <p>
        My name is Stefan, I am a 26 year old guy living in Uppsala, Sweden.
        I've always found enjoyment in solving problems, be it mathematical,
        sudokus, brain teasers, etc. I believe this is the main reason why I
        enjoy programming, since programming is, at its core, about solving one
        problem after another to eventually end up with a finished product.

        Around 10 years ago, I was diagnosed with Aspberger syndrome. In my
        case, it means that I generally have a harder timer than most at social
        interactions. I am terrible at small-talk and I might not look a person
        in the eye when speaking to them. While I may not be the most talkative
        person when it comes to everyday life, I will speak my mind and give
        feedback on others' thoughts when it comes to things I enjoy, such as
        programming.
