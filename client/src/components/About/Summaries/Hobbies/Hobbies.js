        The thing I enjoy more than anything else is video games. Video games
        have always been a part of my life ever since I was a small child. Some
        of the games I've enjoyed the most are RuneScape, Path of Exile, Mass
        Effect, Witcher, and Dark Souls.

        Just like any other person, I also enjoy listening to music and watching
        TV. I don't have any favorite genres in music but I tend to prefer
        fantasy and sci-fi movies/TV-shows.

        During the warm seasons of the year, I play golf. It is not something
        that I am great at but I thoroughly enjoy it nonetheless. I've played
        golf for around 15 years and currently have 21.3 in handicap.

        During the winter, me and my family like to go skiing. Downhill skiing
        is something I enjoy very much and have very fond memories of from my
        childhood.
