          I'm a guy from Sweden who has always been fascinated by computers and
          video games. As I got older, I didn't know what I wanted to do as a
          profession.
          <br /> I knew I wanted to work with something that had to do with
          computers. I applied for a university course where I learned basic
          programming in C++.
          <br /> Once I got the hang of it, I knew it was what I wanted to do
          for a living.
          <br /> Since then, I've taken a multitude of different university
          courses where I learned different aspects of programming.
          <br /> I learned other prominent languages, such as C# and Java, I
          also learned how to develop software for mobile devices as well as how
          to program AI used in video games.
          <br />
          During the last three years, I've worked toward a bachelor degree in
          computer science with the focus being on web development. I achieved
          my bachelor degree in 2020.

          I've always loved video games. Some of my favorite games are Mass
          Effect, Witcher, RuneScape, Path of Exile, and Dark Souls.
          <br /> After I got my bachelor degree, I've started to program more on
          my spare time.
          <br />
          When I'm not at the computer I play golf, which I love. During the
          winters, when the golf courses are closed, I love to downhill skii
          (slalom).
